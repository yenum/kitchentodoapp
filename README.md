About the project:

This web application was built using React Js. It allows the user enter tasks they need to complete in their kitchn. As it is a kitchen app, the design is created to reflect such.

Features of the App:
The user is able to add tasks, edit tasks and edit tasks from the application. There is also the feature that allows the user cross off items to indicate completion. This feature was put in place to give the user the chance to mark off items without the need to delete the item off the list.

Technical Knowledge used:

I used Ract Hooks to manage state within the application. I also used plain CSS to add the styles on the application. I also deployed on Netlify.

You can see a live demo and view the application in action.
