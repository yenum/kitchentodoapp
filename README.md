# Kitchen To-Do App
## Version 1.2.1

This is a simple web application that helps track to do items. The user is able to tasks, edit,tasks and delete tasks as needed within the user interface. Another feature of the application is for users to 'mark off' completed tasks if they do not want to delete it immediately.


## About the project:

This web application was built using React Js. It allows the user enter tasks they need to complete in their kitchn. As it is a kitchen app, the design is created to reflect such.

## Features of the App:

The user is able to add tasks, edit tasks and delete tasks from the application. There is also the feature that allows the user cross off items to indicate completion. This feature was put in place to give the user the chance to mark off items without the need to delete the item off the list.

## Technical Knowledge used:

I built this application using Reactjs and used React Hooks to manage state within the application. I also used plain CSS to add the styles on the application and I deployed the application on Netlify.

## Reflections:

- This could be scaled up to become a full stack application which require a connection to a REST API which has added authenication.
- This application could also be improved by testing the code using Test Driven Development (TDD) to make the application a lot more robust and stable.

You can see a live demo and view the application in action.
